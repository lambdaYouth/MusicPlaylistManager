# MusicPlaylistManager

A simple web-based music playlist manager that allows users to create and manage playlists, add songs, and play them (just the name of the song). This project utilises data structures such as Linked Lists, Arrays, and Queues to handle playlist creation, song management, and playback.
Working:

1. Create a playlist by entering a playlist name.
2. Add songs to an existing playlist.
3. View all songs in a playlist.
4. Play the next song in the playlist.
